# CS-300Portfolio

# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem that we were addressing in this course was sorting and printing courses for the computer science department of ABCU. We needed to design a data structure to store and sort all of the class information and then look up one courses info or print all of the courses in order.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached this problem by creating a BST data structure.  In order to create a BST it was important to understand linked lists, vectors, and structures.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I overcame roadblocks by using the debugging features in the IDE.  By setting breakpoints and stepping over the code one line at the time I was able to see if a variable had the wrong value or was not initialized properly and solve any issues I had.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project has expanded my approach to designing software by adding data structures to my development approach.  Through this work I am more prepared to develop solutions for sorting and storing data as well as able to analyze the efficiency of sorting algorithms.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Working on this project has allowed me to get better at making modular code.  I got experience combining several different types of data structures to create one structure that will sort and output complex data types.
